### Hey!

- My Projects (but organized on a website): [https://jaideng1.github.io](https://jaideng1.github.io)

# A bit about me:

- I’m currently working on my portfolio and a new game (not sharing what it is tho ;>)
- I'm a student (not going to share which grade I'm in)
- I’m currently learning about OpenStreetAPI and OpenGL
- Pronouns: He/Him (Idc if you use they/them)
- Fun fact: I'm really bad at finishing projects (lol), but it might just be that I always want to improve things in projects
